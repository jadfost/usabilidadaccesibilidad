00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.500
You prolly think that you are
better now, better now

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.533
You only say that 'cause I'm
not around, not around

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.933
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.366
Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.766
You know I say that I am
better now, better now

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.933
I only say that 'cause you're
not around, not around

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.233
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.566
Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.966
Oh-oh

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.733
I did not believe that
it would end, no

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.200
Everything came second
to the benzo

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.233
You're not even speakin'
to my friends, no

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.366
You knew all my uncles
and my aunts though

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.466
Twenty candles, blow 'em
out and open your eyes

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.733
We were lookin' forward to
the rest of our lives

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.166
Used to keep my picture posted
by your bedside

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.333
Now it's in your dresser with
the socks you don't like

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.433
And I'm rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin'

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.266
With my brothers like
it's jonas, jonas

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.366
Drinkin' henny
and I'm tryna forget

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.566
But I can't get this
shit outta my head

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
You prolly think that you are
better now, better now

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.833
You only say that 'cause I'm
not around, not around

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.266
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.400
Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.866
You know I say that I am
better now, better now

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.200
I only say that 'cause you're
not around, not around

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:41.633
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.866
Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600
Oh-oh

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.833
I seen you with
your other dude

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.200
He seemed like
he was pretty cool

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.500
I was so broken over you

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.300
Life it goes on,
what can you do?

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.200
I just wonder what it's gonna
take (whats it gonna take)

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:05.433
Another foreign or a bigger
chain (bigger chain)

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.600
Because no matter how my life
has changed (no matter how
my life has changed)

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.300
I keep on looking
back on better days

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.600
You prolly think that you are
better now, better now

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.933
You only say that 'cause I'm
not around, not around

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.300
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.633
Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:27.733
You know I say that I am
better now, better now

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:31.100
I only say that 'cause you're
not around, not around

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.300
You know I never meant to let
you down, let you down

Woulda gave you anything, woulda
gave you everything

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:39.333
Oh-oh

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:40.466
I promise

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.466
I swear to you,
I'll be okay

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.933
You're only the love of my
life (love of my life)

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.533
You prolly think that you are
better now, better now

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.533
